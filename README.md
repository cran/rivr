rivr: An R package for Open Channel Hydraulics
==============================================

This package is designed as an educational tool for students and instructors 
of undergraduate courses in open channel hydraulics. Functions are provided 
for computing normal and critical depths, steady-state water surface profiles 
(e.g. backwater curves) and unsteady flow computations (e.g. flood wave 
routing).
