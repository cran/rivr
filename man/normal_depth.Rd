\description{
Calculate the normal (equilibrium) depth using Manning's equation.
}
\details{
The normal depth is the equilibrium depth of a channel for a given 
  flow rate, channel slope, geometry and roughness.
  Manning's equation is used to calculate the equilibrium depth. Manning's 
  equation for normal flow is defined as \deqn{Q = \frac{C_m}{n} AR^{2/3}S_0^{1/2}}
  where \eqn{Q} is the channel flow, \eqn{S_0} is the channel slope, \eqn{A} is the 
  cross-sectional flow area, \eqn{R} is the hydraulic depth and \eqn{C_m} is a conversion factor
  based on the unit system used. This function uses a Newton-Raphson root-finding approach 
  to calculate the normal depth, i.e.
  \eqn{y = y_n} when \deqn{f(y) = \frac{A^{5/3}}{P^{2/3}} - \frac{nQ}{C_mS_0^{1/2}} = 0}.
